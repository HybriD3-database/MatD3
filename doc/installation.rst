Installation
================

This project can be installed by cloning the repository preceded by other steps that assist installing 

  https://github.com/HybriD3-database/MatD3

It's a public project, so anybody is able to clone the source code and create issues and merge requests. In order to contribute to the project directly, contact one of the MatD\ :sup:`3` team members who will then grant you the developer status. For pull/push privileges you must upload your RSA public key to GitHub. If you already have one, it is likely located at ``~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``. If not, the RSA public/private key pair can be generated by issuing

.. code:: bash

  ssh-keygen

It is sufficient to press enter at each query until the keys have been generated. However, protecting the key with a password would be a good idea if you intend to keep it on a public server. Then, at the GitHub website, go to your settings, find "SSH keys", and enter the public key. You can upload several keys in order to have pull/push access from more than one computer. 

From a command line prompt (i.e., using a terminal application, which is usually provided along with any Unix/Linux distribution or with MacOS), you can now clone the Git repository with

.. code:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/HybriD3-database/MatD3.git

The result of this command should be the creation of a directory ``MatD3`` that contains the software needed to operate the MatD3 database.
