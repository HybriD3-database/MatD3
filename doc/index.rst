============================================
Welcome to the MatD\ :sup:`3` documentation!
============================================

The MatD\ :sup:`3` database is designed to store and curate materials data for solid materials. It is part of a NSF-DMREF-funded project (DMR-1729297). This document provides details on the database structure, how to set up a web interface for interacting with the database, and some details on the usage of the website. Currently, there is one live instance of the database, accessible at https://materials.hybrid3.duke.edu/. We also explain how to interface the MatD\ :sup:`3` website with the Qresp web application.

An overview of the database software is found in the following reference:
