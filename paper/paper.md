The discovery of new materials as well as the determination of a vast set of materials properties for science and technology is an exploding field, spread out across a vast community of small, mid-sized and large research groups worldwide. Materials data from individual research groups is traditionally disseminated by means of loosely interconnected, peer-reviewed publications. Individual large data-centric efforts such as the Materials Project [@jain13], Nomad [@nomad], Aflow [@curtarolo12], The Open Quantum Materials Database [@saal13], or the Materials Data Facility [@blaiszik16] are making large segments of materials data publicly available. However, these efforts are typically not designed to cover the complete and diverse body of research results available from the many active groups in the literature (experimental or computational, data referring to the atomic scale, mesoscale, phase-pure or composite materials, etc.). They typically focus on a specific level of theory, type of materials, or type of data (experimental/theoretical), whereas we propose a solution that has no such limitations. Traditional data curation efforts such as SpringerMaterials [@springermaterials] or topical reviews have long supported the task of summarizing diverse sets of materials data from the community, but has only focused on subcategories of materials, leading to a lag between new discoveries and the availability of data in curated, reusable collections. Small and large research groups are struggling to find and access scientific data presented in scientific papers due to the lack of established queriable web interfaces to heterogenous sets of data.

MatD3 is an open-source, dedicated database and web application framework designed for the task of storing, curating and disseminating experimental and theoretical materials data generated by individual research groups or research consortia. A research group can set up its own instance of MatD3 and publish scientific results or simply use an existing online MatD3 instance. Disseminating research data in this form enables broader access, reproducibility, and repurpose of scientific products. MatD3 is a general purpose database that does not focus on any specific level of theory or experimental method. Instead, the focus is on storing accurate data with functionality making it easy to curate the data that is on the database.

MatD3 deploys a structured (SQL) database which, along with RESTful APIs (application programming interface for representational state transfer), allows easy access and manipulation of the uderlying datasets. The data submission interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with numerous help tips to guide the user through each step. Setting up the servers includes fairly standard steps which are described in the online documentation <https://hybrid3-database.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.

A counterpart to MatD3 is the Qresp web application [@govoni19], which is a tool to facilitate scientific data reproducibility by making available, in a distributed manner, all data and procedures presented in scientific papers, together with metadata to render them searchable and discoverable. The two main components of Qresp are *i)* the curator, guiding users in the creation of metadata for the data that accompanies a publishable scientific work, and *ii)* the explorer, a GUI for accessing datasets, exploring workflows, and downloading curated data, published in scientific papers.

We have implemented extensions to the Qresp and MatD3 interfaces, allowing collaborators to enter both their data as well as the associated publication and reproducibility information in a single workflow â€” i.e., to reduce as much as possible the effort to enter all research data for a given material. Specifically, the developed web GUI facilitates: *i)* the creation of a MatD3 entry with simultaneous generation of the corresponding metadata for the Qresp database, *ii)* the generation of Qresp metadata for an already existing MatD3 entry, and *iii)* the generation of MatD3 entries from the Qresp metadata. While the developed coupling between two softwares is not limited to specific servers, we showcase the concurrent use of MatD3 and Qresp with two specific instances installed at the Duke University (<https://materials.hybrid3.duke.edu/> and <https://qresp.hybrid3.duke.edu/>). Setting up MatD3 and Qresp instances to communicate with each other requires one to specify only a few environment variables, as detailed in the MatD3 documentation. Moreover, Qresp can serve as a frontend to any database that has the same API as MatD3 for submitting new data.

In summary, the MatD3 software provides a convenient, flexible, and complete solution for a web facing materials database for individual research groups and consortia. The availability of this solution will enable the community to take a significant step forward in making available the vast trove of newly generated materials research data directly for validation and reuse, in a convenient form that is directly amendable to processing by computational analysis or visualization software as well as quantitative data comparison and reproduction.
